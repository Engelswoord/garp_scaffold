# Garp 3

Garp is a flexible opensource PHP and frontend framework and CMS.   
Developed with love by Grrr, from Amsterdam.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get setup is by creating a new project using Composer and the [Garp3
Scaffold](https://github.com/grrr-amsterdam/garp_scaffold):

```bash
composer create-project grrr-amsterdam/garp3-scaffold <your-target-directory>
```

See the Garp3 scaffold readme for more information on building assets and such.
